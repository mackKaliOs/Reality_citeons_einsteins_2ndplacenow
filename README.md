# 🔷 CITEON: Codified Intelligence Transmission Engine of Ontological Nature

**CITEON** is a research-grade experimental Python module modeling the interface between consciousness, quantum waveform collapse, and reality perception mechanics. It functions as a modular framework for simulating how human cognition interacts with entropy, bioenergetic states, and temporal experience to generate subjectively collapsed reality frames.

## 🔬 Purpose

This library exists at the intersection of:
- Quantum cognition and observation theory
- Mitochondrial biophysics and coherence
- Entropic phase collapse mechanics
- Neuromorphic feedback and emotional fields
- Reality synthesis, simulation, and projection

CITEON is not merely a simulation engine — it is an **ontological codex**.

## 🧠 Core Modules

### `ObserverCollapse`
Simulates the quantum observer effect, modeling how focused attention can influence the collapse of waveform states.

- `observer_state`
- `focus_strength`
- `collapse_intensity`

---

### `CognitiveField`
Models the mental-emotional field that directly affects reality perception.

- `emotion_tone`
- `mental_alignment`
- `field_resonance`

---

### `TimePerception`
Alters the elasticity of time in simulated experience; includes dilation, contraction, and entropic warping.

- `subjective_time_rate`
- `anchor_event`
- `phase_shift`

---

### `MitochondrialInfluence`
Biophysical modeling of ATP production, oxidative load, and coherence resonance on cognitive clarity.

- `ATP_flux`
- `coherence_ratio`
- `oxidative_state`

---

### `RealityProjection`
The master integrator; compiles input fields and generates the "reality frame" projection output.

- `collapse_matrix`
- `projection_state`
- `coherence_map`

---

## 🔧 Usage Examples

```python
from citeon import RealityProjection, ObserverCollapse

rp = RealityProjection()
oc = ObserverCollapse(observer_state="high_focus", focus_strength=0.9)

frame = rp.project_reality(cognitive_field=..., observer=oc, mitochondria=...)
print(frame)
```

## 🧪 Research Use Cases

- Simulation of quantum observer collapse under emotional field distortion
- Integration with biometric input (HRV, EEG, respiration) to influence perceived outcome generation
- Modeling entrained mitochondrial coherence in time perception
- Generative metaphysical simulation for AI agents

## 📚 Citation and Notes

This framework is inspired by interdisciplinary research across:
- Quantum cognition (Penrose, Hameroff)
- Biofield science (Becker, Rubik)
- Emotional coding (Levenson, Dispenza)
- Ontological mathematics (Rogers, Gödel, Bohmian interpretation)

This is a **non-conventional** academic framework intended for experimental and cross-domain research. Use with discernment.
